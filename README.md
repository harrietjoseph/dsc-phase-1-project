# Phase 1 Project
###TASK : DATA SCIENCE PROJECT ON THE PEFORMANCE OF BOXOFFICE FILMS TO GIVE ACCURATE INSIGHTS TO THE HEAD OF MICROSOFT NEW MOVIE STUDIO ON WHAT STEPS TO TAKE FOR BETTER PERFOMANCE IN THE BUSINESS
Microsft company plans on creating a new movie studio like other companies that are already in the film making industry,creating original video content. This is a new field that Microsoft wants to explore and therefore as a company they have very little knowledge about it. As a data scientist, my responsibility is to explore on data and find out the best perfoming box office films, so as to give insights to the Head of Microsoft's new movie studio ; to help decide what types of films should be created.

the data i choose to use where as follows:

* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

The columns in this business problem are:(according to the provided data)

original_title: the original title of the film
start_year: the year the film was released
runtime_minutes: the duration of the film in minutes
genres: the genre(s) of the film
averagerating: the average rating of the film based on reviews
numvotes: the number of votes the film received
studio: the studio that produced the film
domestic_gross: the gross revenue generated by the film in the domestic market
foreign_gross: the gross revenue generated by the film in the foreign market
release_date: the release date of the film
movie: the film being referred to
production_budget: the budget allocated for the production of the film
worldwide_gross: the gross revenue generated by the film worldwide.
Requirements

Load the Data with Pandas Create a dataframes movie_gross_df, title_bsc_df ,title_rts_df and movie_bdgt_df that represent the four CSV files. Use pandas methods to inspect the shape and other attributes of these dataframes.

Perform Data Cleaning Required Identify and handle missing values Identify and handle text data requiring cleaning

the questions i'll be answering in this project:

What are the most successful film genres and themes at the box office?
What is the correlation between column data ?
What are the characteristics of successful films that the new movie studio should consider?
What actionable insights can be provided to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio to help them create successful films?

revenue(foreign_gross & domestic_gross)
Revenue can greatly affect the production of specific movie genres. If a particular genre is consistently generating high revenue, then studios are more likely to invest in producing more movies within that genre. This is because studios want to make money, and they are more likely to fund projects that have a higher likelihood of financial success. On the other hand, if a particular genre is not generating enough revenue, studios may be less likely to invest in producing movies within that genre.


###reasons why certain studios may have higher ratings compared to others:
Quality of content: The studio may consistently produce high-quality content that appeals to audiences, resulting in high ratings.

Budget: Studios with larger budgets can afford to produce higher-quality content and hire top talent, leading to higher ratings.

Marketing: A well-executed marketing campaign can help generate positive buzz and attract more viewers, leading to higher ratings.

Niche market: The studio may focus on a specific niche market that appeals to a highly engaged audience, leading to higher ratings.

Collaboration: The studio may have strong partnerships with other studios or production companies, allowing them to access top talent and resources, leading to higher ratings.



###why the downtrend overtime
as observed a bove there is a downtrend overall from 2016

The reason for a downtrend in the start year from 2016 to 2018 for columns such as numvotes, averagerating, foreign_gross, and domestic_gross could be due to several factors. Some possible reasons include:

Changing audience preferences: The tastes and preferences of moviegoers may have changed, leading to a decline in popularity for certain genres.

Increased competition: With the proliferation of streaming services and home entertainment options, there may be more competition for audiences' attention, leading to a decline in box office revenue and ratings.

Economic factors: Economic conditions, such as a recession or changes in consumer spending, may have led to a decline in movie-going.

Changes in the film industry: The film industry may have undergone changes, such as changes in distribution methods or a decline in the number of theaters, that have led to a decline in the popularity of movies.


the foreign and domestic gross that can be referred as revenue, as shown above, positively correlate.
it means that as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable also increases. In other words, there is a positive relationship between the two variables. This could indicate that, for example, a movie that is successful in its domestic market (domestic_gross) is likely to also be successful in foreign markets (foreign_gross), or vice versa.


numvotes is seen to positively correlate with foreign_gross, domestic_gross. So in this case, if the number of votes for a movie increases, it could be expected that the domestic and foreign gross of the movie will also increase. This could indicate that movies that are more popular among audiences tend to generate higher revenue both domestically and internationally. However, it is important to keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation and there could be other factors that contribute to this relationship.
Revenue can greatly affect the production of specific movie genres. If a particular genre is consistently generating high revenue, then studios are more likely to invest in producing more movies within that genre. This is because studios want to make money, and they are more likely to fund projects that have a higher likelihood of financial success. On the other hand, if a particular genre is not generating enough revenue, studios may be less likely to invest in producing movies within that genre. The revenue generated by a movie can be influenced by various factors such as the popularity of the actors, the budget for the production, marketing and advertising efforts, and the overall market demand for the genre. we can clearly see that there is a positive correlation between the domestic gross and the budget.

conclusion :
Based on the trends you have identified, it may be recommended that Microsoft's new movie studio focus on creating films in the popular genres of action, adventure, comedy, drama, and biopic. Additionally, considering the downtrend in foreign and domestic grosses, as well as declining number of votes and average ratings from 2016 to 2018, the studio may want to focus on producing films that have a strong appeal to both domestic and international audiences. Additionally, it may be beneficial to invest in improving the production quality and overall marketability of the films to increase their chances of success. It may also be helpful to regularly analyze box office trends and make adjustments to the studio's strategy as needed to stay competitive.
